# ClaimTrace

This is **ClaimTrace**, a little project which aims to tackle the "fake news" problem using some AI tools and digital forensics. It's basically a tool that takes a news image and a claim (the headline), then runs a bunch of checks to see if they actually match up or if something fishy is going on.



### Working

ClaimTrace uses a mutli-layered approach to detect a fake news:



- **AI Image Detection:** It checks if the image itself was generated by AI.

- **Logical Contradiction Check**: it uses **BLIP-2** to "see" the image and then compares that visual evidence against your text claim using an **NLI (Natural Language Inference** model.

- **Digital Tampering (ELA):** It performs **Error Level Analysis** to highlight potential Photopshop jobs or "spliced" objects.

- **Location and Entity Verifier:** It extracts locations and dates from the caption and tries to verify if the viusals support those specific details.

- **Recycled Media Check:** Added a small hash-based database to spot famous hoaxes or stock photos that keep getting reused.



### Tech Stack

I built this using:

- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI

- **Frontend:** A clean dashboard using Bootstrap

- **ML Models:** `Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b` for vision-to-text, `cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base` for checking contradictions and `SpaCy` for pulling out locations and dates.

- **Deployment:** `pyngrok` for easy testing via public URL



### How to run it

You can run this project in two ways:



1. **Google Colab (Easy):**
   
   If you don't have a high-end GPU, use the notebook. It handles all the enviroment setup for you.
   
   - Open `ClaimTrace.ipynb` in Colab.
   
   - Make sure your runtime is set to **T4 GPU**.
   
   - Run the cells in order. The last cell will give you an **ngrok URL** to open the web dashboard. **Caution:** Make sure you have pasted your own `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN` in the designated spot.

2.  **Local Machine:**
   
   If you have got an NVIDIA GPU and want to run it as a standalone app:
   
   **Clone and Setup:**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZohaibHassan16/ClaimTrace.git
   cs ClaimTrace
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



   **Launch the App:**

```bash
python.app.py
```

Then just open the resulting hosting link in your browser.
