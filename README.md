## VeritasLens: Media Forensic dashboard



#### Project overview:

&nbsp;                              This project is a hands-on attempt to build a simple but powerful tool for media forensics; specifically, checking if a news image and its caption are consistent, authentic, and not generated by AI.

In the age of deepfakes and viral misinformation, simply looking at an image isn't enough. VeritasLens brings together several state-of-the-art AI and forensic techniques into one dashboard to give a quick "fact-check" score.



#### Tech Stack:

&nbsp;                   VeritasLens is built on a few core components, each handling a different part of the verification:

1. **Forensic Analysis:** Detects digital tampering and known media re-use. ELA(Error Level Analysis for tampering; *imagehash* (pHash) for duplicate detection, though this requires API which I haven't added yet).
2. **AI Generation Check**: Determines the likelihood of the image being AI-generated (a deepfake). Relies on *umm-maybe/AI-image-detector* (Hugging Face Model). 
3. **Visual Q\&A:** Generates a description of the image and answers questions about its contents(e.g., "What is the location?"). Relies on *Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b* (vision-language model).
4. **Semantic consistency:** Checks if the user's text caption matches the AI's visual description. Relies on *cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base* (Natural Language Inference).
5.  **Entity Extraction:** Pulls out key locations (GPE) and dates from the user's caption for cross-checking. Relies on *spaCy* (en\_core\_web-sm).





#### The Dashboard:

* &nbsp;                        **Backend: FastAPI** is used to create a lightweight. modern web API that handles the image upload, runs the analysis logic **(*NewsVerifer*** class), and sends the result back.
* **Frontend:** A simple, single-page dashboard that built with **HTML/CSS (BootStrap)** and **JavaScript** to display the report clearly.
* **Deployment:** *Uvicorn* runs the FastAPI server, and *ngrok* creates a secure tunnel to the local server can be accessed via a public URL from the Colab notebook.

#### How to Run the Code:

&nbsp;                                   This project is designed to easily run in a Google Colab environment, leveraging its free GPU for the large models.

1. **Upload the Notebook:** Upload the `Veritas\_lens.ipynb` file to your Google Colab session.
2. **Run Cells 1, 2 and 3**: These steps install dependencies, load the large AI models, and set up the FastAPI server/dashboard code.
3. **Run Cell 4 (Start Server):**

      This will initialize the `pyngrok` tunnel.
